# letCodeInPractice

## Description
PlaywrightMSTest is a functional automation project I'm working on while I'm unemployed. This is an attempt to learn new a new automation tool called Playwright and also get back into my .NET days using C#. Since I have the freedom and more time to explore and learn additional tips and tricks, I might as well continue automating sites I find interesting.

This will be a .NET project with Playwright using MSTest as the automation framework. Depending on how involved letcode.in is, I plan on commiting many types of files in order to expand my understanding of file types and the power and flexibility they can bring to the repository.
